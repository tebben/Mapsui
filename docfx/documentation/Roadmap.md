# Roadmap 2018

Last year was focused on getting v1 more stable. This year is focused on making Mapsui easier to get started with for new users and making it easier to use for more kinds of users. So what's up:

- Adding a Xamarin.Forms MapControl.
- Getting started tutorials for all platforms.
- Show all samples in the iOS and Android projects.
- Improve the samples. Make them smaller (single purpose). Make them look better. Add comments.
- Start a proper documentation website.
- Go to .NET Standard
