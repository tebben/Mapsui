# Samples
The best way to get started with mapsui is to go through the samples.

## The code samples
The code for each sample can be found in the folder: [Samples\Mapsui\Mapsui.Samples.Common\Maps](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Common/Maps).

## Run the samples
See the samples in action by running the  WPF sample app ([Mapsui.Samples.Wpf](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Wpf)) in the samples folder. On the left side it has a list with all samples.
